# Sales-Prediction
A central problem in data science is predicting the future of time series data. In recent years
many sophisticated methods have been applied to forecast time series data. Neural networks are
a subset of machine learning, in which the computer learns to perform some task by analyzing
training data sets. In this project, neural networks are trained with the Back-Propagation
algorithm for predicting sales and further, it is used for classifying images containing different
face portraits. The different optimization methods and activation functions that are used along
with Back-Propagation algorithm to train the neural networks have also been discussed.
